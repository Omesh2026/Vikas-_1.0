        <p class="Agri_Tourism_top_para">In order to increase the contribution of agriculture sector, the existing <br>
               agricultural activities must be strengthened with the provision of additional <br>
            income generating activities. Tourism can be of a boon in this <br>
            The clubbing of tourism with agriculture would serve the aim of increasing the <br>
            contribution from agriculture sector to the GDP and thereby facilitating the
            economic development. </p>
        <p class="Agri_Tourism_top_para">Tourism is recognized as a boosting factor of growth in the <br> various economies
            in the world. Several countries have transformed their economies by <br>
            developing their tourism potential. Promotion of tourism would bring many
            direct and indirect benefits to the <br> people.  Tourism has great capacity to
            generate large-scale employment and additional income sources to the skilled <br>
            and unskilled group of general people. Today the perception of old-fashioned <br>
            tourism has been changed. Some new zones of the tourism have been emerged
            like Agro-Tourism. </p>

                There are a range of other forms of rural tourism which are not necessarily a <br>
part of agro-tourism in the strict sense, e.g. ethno-tourism, project tourism, <br>
health tourism, historical tourism, cultural tourism or adventure tourism. The <br>
term 'agro-ecotourism' is generally synonymous with 'agro-tourism'.

                Kerala is one of the major tourist centers in the India and there is large scope <br>
and great potential to develop agro-tourism. Kerala in the perspective of <br>
tourism is often called as god's own country.
